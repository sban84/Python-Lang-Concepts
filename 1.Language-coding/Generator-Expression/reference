The difference is that while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function
saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.


Unlike normal functions, the local variables are not destroyed when the function yields. Furthermore, the generator object can be iterated only once.

To restart the process we need to create another generator object using something
like itr_obj = my_gen().
